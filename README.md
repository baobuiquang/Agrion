## Introduction
#### COVID-19 virus pandemic
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious global disease. The virus was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019. COVID-19 disease is caused by the virus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a new virus in humans causing respiratory illness which can be spread from person-to-person.

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
#### Analysis and Diagnosis of COVID-19
Analysis, or the process of turning raw data into insights, can provide us with a view of how the virus influences the communities. Those insights can indicate if the development of a country affects its virus spread as well as the relationship between the infection rate, the death rate and the recovered rate of COVID-19 pandemic in some specific countries and on the global.

The quick diagnosis method is significant in preventing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. With the dataset of approximately 1000 images of chest X-ray collected, we can build a machine learning model to predict whether a new X-ray image is from a COVID-19 infected patient or a non-infected person.

## Method
### Overall Approach
#### Python
Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built-in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development. Python is commonly used to streamline large complex data sets.

Python has a long list of powerful libraries available for all users. That’s a key factor that gives a strong push for Python at all, and in the data science, too. Libraries such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) are very powerful for data manipulation and libraries such as [MatplotLib](https://matplotlib.org/), [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) provide great visualization.
#### Machine Learning
Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.

A machine learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize certain types of patterns. You train a model over a set of data, providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over and learn from those data. Once you have trained the model, you can use it to reason over data that it hasn't seen before, and make predictions about those data.
#### TensorFlow
[TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) is an end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

[TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) is a library for machine learning in JavaScript. Develop ML models in JavaScript, and use ML directly in the browser.
### Detailed Design
#### Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows us to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. 

The Jupyter Notebook is used to support interactive data science and scientific computing across many programming languages, especially Python.
#### Python Modules
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (data analysis and manipulation)
- [numpy](https://numpy.org/) (scientific computing)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) (statistical data visualization)
- [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) (visualizations)
#### Teachable Machine
Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. The models made with Teachable Machine are real [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) models that work anywhere javascript runs, so they play nice with tools like Glitch, P5.js, Node.js & more.
#### ml5.js
[ml5.js](https://ml5js.org/) aims to make machine learning approachable for a broad audience of artists, creative coders, and students. The folks building TensorFlow.js figured out that it is possible to use the web browser's built-in graphics processing unit (GPU) to do calculations that would otherwise run very slowly using the central processing unit (CPU). The ml5.js library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser, building on top of TensorFlow.js with no other external dependencies. 
#### p5.js
Using the metaphor of a sketch, [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) has a full set of drawing functionality, consider the whole browser page as your sketch, including HTML5 objects for text, input, video, webcam, and sound.

## COVID-19 virus spread analysis
<!-- COVID-19 virus spread analysis -->
#### Note
- The latest datasets can be used (from the sources I mentioned above), as long as the files' structure hasn't been changed.
- Adjust the values in `.sort_values` method to the latest date in the datasets.
- Change the `name_country` in `.loc[country_name]` method to see the data of what country you want.
- `.head(1000)` lists all the rows in dataset. Change `1000` to the number of rows you want to list. `.head()` will list 5 rows by default.
- Use `dataset_name.shape` to see the number of rows and columns of the dataset.

*Countries with the lowest confirmed cases*

#### Look at the data in some specific countries about confirmed cases
Calculate the first derivative to see the spread rate

##### Infection rate in Vietnam


```python
# Calculate the first derivative of the curve
dataset_cases.loc["Vietnam"].diff().plot(figsize=(14, 6), legend = True, title = 'Infection rate in Vietnam')
```




    <AxesSubplot:title={'center':'Infection rate in Vietnam'}>

```python
# Find the max_infection_rate for Vietnam
dataset_cases.loc["Vietnam"].diff().max()
```




    50.0



The `max_infection_rate` in Vietnam is **50.0**

##### Compare the Infection rate in some countries: Vietnam, United State, Italy, Japan and China


```python
# Calculate the first derivative of the curve

dataset_cases.loc["US"].diff().plot(figsize=(14, 6), legend = True, color = 'orange', title = 'Compare the Infection rate in some countries: Vietnam, United State, Italy, Japan and China')
dataset_cases.loc["Italy"].diff().plot(legend = True, color = 'purple')
dataset_cases.loc["China"].diff().plot(legend = True, color = 'brown')
dataset_cases.loc["Japan"].diff().plot(legend = True, color = 'green')
dataset_cases.loc["Vietnam"].diff().plot(legend = True)

```python
# Find the max_infection_rate for US
dataset_cases.loc["US"].diff().max()
```




    77255.0



The `max_infection_rate` in US is **77255.0**

#### Calculate the `max_infection_rate` of all countries and add to `dataset_cases`


```python
# Cast the index of dataframe (name of countries) into list
countries = list(dataset_cases.index)

#Calculate max_infection_rate of all countries
max_infection_rate = []
for country in countries:
    max_infection_rate.append(dataset_cases.loc[country].diff().max())

#Add new column
dataset_cases["max_infection_rate"] = max_infection_rate

## COVID-19 virus diagnosis from radiography
<!-- COVID-19 virus diagnosis from radiography -->
### Samples Gathering
```
└── 📁dataset_radiography
    ├── 📁data_for_training
    │   ├── 📁covid_infected
    │   │   └── More than 800 JPEG images
    │   └── 📁normal
    │       └── More than 800 JPEG images
    └── 📁data_for_testing
        ├── 📁covid_infected
        │   └── 100 JPEG images
        └── 📁normal
            └── 100 JPEG images
```
More than 1600 samples, include 800 X-ray JPEG images of COVID-19 infected patients and 800 X-ray JPEG images of normal people are used to train the model. We keep the remain 100 images of each category for testing after the model was trained.
### Model Trainging
Teachable Machine is using a technique called [transfer learning](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/transfer_learning). There is a pre-trained model. Somebody else already trained a model on many, many samples, and this model is called [MobileNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf). And the training data for this model is called [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/papers/imagenet_cvpr09.pdf).

[MobileNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.04861.pdf) is a model that runs fast, works in the browser, and knows about a lot of different kinds of things. But it doesn't necessarily know whether the X-ray image belongs to a COVID-19 infected patient or a normal person. Maybe it's in there, maybe it's not. But what we could do is take the fact that it's learned how to boil the essence of images down into a bunch of different numbers, to then retrain it with our own images.

And this allows us to train a machine learning model with 1600 samples from the dataset we have gathered. Because if we were training an image classification model from scratch without this base model, you probably would need a much larger data set.

### Testing

![png](assets/diag-covid.gif)

## Results
#### Analysis Conclusion
- The result shows that people who are living in a more developed country (higher GDP per capita) are more prone to get infection of the COVID-19 virus.
- The maximum recovery rate of a country is not affected by its development. Developed countries are as vulnerable to COVID-19 pandemic as developing countries.

#### Diagnosis Accuracy
196/200 (98%) test cases have the right results. The trained model has recognized whether an X-ray image belongs to a COVID-19 infected patient or a non-infected person.

#### Strengths of the method
- Based on the existing open-source platform, we can quickly build a machine learning model that can diagnose the COVID-19 disease from the radiography images.
- The technique used here is transfer learning, we have MobileNet helps us to boil the essence of images down into a bunch of different numbers, and then we just retrain it with our own samples.

#### Limitations of the method
- The practical application of this research absolutely depends on the sample resource, namely the X-ray images of COVID-19 infected patient and non-infected person, both must be taken in the same condition and environment.

#### Important Notice
⚠ This research is intended for **educational purposes only**. As the "Limitations of the method" mentioned, the practical application of this research absolutely depends on the sample resource, and the trained model in this project does not satisfy it. Please do not use the results without real clinical researches!
